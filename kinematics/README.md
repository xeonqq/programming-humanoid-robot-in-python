# Week 3: Kinematics
This week you need to implement forward and inverse kinematics for NAO robot, and test in simulation. You may first take a look at [2D forward and inverse kinematics](robot_arm_2d.ipynb) with ipython notebook, then complete the code in [forward_kinematics.py](./forward_kinematics.py) and [inverse_kinematics.py](./inverse_kinematics.py).

The documentation of NAO can be found here: http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/family/nao_h25/index_h25.html#nao-h25
